# Grab Ideas: Write them, Publish them, Be your own audience

I often have brilliant ideas and summarize them in my scratch book. But later on they were trashed and those great ideas are lost. The BEST way to avoid missing brilliant random ideas is to write it in a pdf file on overleaf.com and publish it on the personal blog.

Publishing means that the materials are for the public. The pressure from public scruitiny forces concise and succinct writing. All the questions and arguments are well-clarified to avoid the confusion not only from other audience but also the author himself. Review and revision then become efficient.

Writing in PDF means later on I can have version control and build the revision on the previous work. It is a natural process of writing polishing. 

Let's see whether I can focus on writing on something consistently.
