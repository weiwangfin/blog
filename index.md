# Grab Ideas: Write them, Publish them, Be your own audience

I often have ideas and summarize them in my scratch book. But later on they were trashed and lost. The BEST way to avoid missing good ideas is to write it in a pdf file on overleaf.com and publish it on the personal blog.

Publishing means that the materials are for public scruitiny. It forces concise and succinct writing. All the questions and arguments are well-clarified to avoid the confusion. This will benefit not only other audience but also the author himself. *Human has very bad memory.*

Writing in latex provides another advantage: I can have version control and build on my previous work. It is a natural process of writing polishing.
