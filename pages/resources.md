# What did I miss when studying abroad?
When approaching  graduation, I find myself unable to utilize my time to know more about  daily life  in  the US. The most salient example is that I cannot really get the  humor  of  their  daily conversation. When I relaxed, watch some TV show.  I start to get their habit to make fun of something or somebody and what they think hilarious.

* Fiction: read fictions or detective novels,  we need  to think from the perspective  of roles inside using our logic. 
* Reading histories, we need to think about why they describe the details and facts.
